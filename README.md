# Weather App

A simple weather app using [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

The weather API provides city name auto-completion and weather data and this app presents it on the front end.

# Installation

To run this app, make sure you have nvm installed, and run `nvm install --lts`. This will install the latest stable version. Currently the project is using `node@23.9.0`.

Once node is installed, `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` to cleanly install the node packages.

To run the app, `npm run dev` to run on your local machine. This will use Vite to run a dev instance of the site, and a link to the running site will appear in the console.
